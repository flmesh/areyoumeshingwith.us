## Architecture

The infrastructure to support the site is deployed via Terraform Infrastructure as Code in the [terraform/](terraform/) directory.

This is handled by the GitHub Actions workflow by PR comment of the Terraform Plan and execution of Terraform apply on merge with the `main` branch.

The current deployment is using AWS Cloudfront CDN with ACM certificate in front of an S3 bucket. All related DNS records are handled by Route53.

## Website

The website is generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static HTML generator that is then deployed into the infrastructure managed via Terraform. The [HB Framework](https://hbstack.dev/) used for the theme layout requires the Hugo extended version along with additional build tools. If you want to run a local dev server to test you will need the [build tool](https://hbstack.dev/docs/getting-started/prerequisites/#build-tools) installed.

### Local dev

**Prerequisites:**
- [Hugo Extended](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) (required for HB Framework)
- [Node.js & npm](https://nodejs.org/)
- [HB Build Tools](https://hbstack.dev/docs/getting-started/prerequisites/#build-tools)

With the prerequisite build tools installed you can run a local dev server to work on you can proceed with the following workflow:

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev
```

This will run a [local webserver](http://localhost:1313/) that you can connect to and view your work.

**Troubleshooting:**
- If you see errors about missing Hugo features, ensure you have the *extended* version.
- If npm commands fail, check your Node.js version (recommend v18+).

### Contributing

If you would like to contribute, fork this repository and work on your content changes/updates. When you are satisfied submit your PR back to this repository to have it included.

**Contribution steps:**
1. Fork this repo and create a new branch for your changes.
2. Make your changes and commit with clear messages.
3. Run `npm run dev` to test locally.
4. Push your branch and open a Pull Request.
5. Add yourself to `content/authors/` if you are a new contributor.

The most common `Hugo` command you'll need to understand will be [hugo new content](https://gohugo.io/commands/hugo_new_content/) as most of the site configuration and theming will not need to be modified. It is beneficial to understand the `Hugo` [directory structure](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/directory-structure/) to better understand how things work together.
